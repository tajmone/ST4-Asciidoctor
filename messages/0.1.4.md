ST4-Asciidoctor v0.1.4
======================

Changes to the package...


Improved Color Scheme
---------------------

The package's native "AsciiDoc Dark" color scheme has been revamped and
polished: improved color palette, better coverage of syntax elements.

> **IMPORTANT** — The package no no longer enforces the scheme by default,
> since some users reported problems due to what seems a bug in Sublime Text
> cache. So you'll have to enable the color scheme for the AsciiDoc syntax
> manually to keep using it.


Syntax Support for Preprocessor Directives
------------------------------------------

Now the syntax handles preprocessor directives (`include::` and the
conditionals `ifdef::`, `ifndef::`, `ifeval::::` and `endif::`).

Although there's still some work to be done to cover the full range of
supported parameters, the syntax already does a decent job at scoping these
directives and their core elements.


Acknowledgments
---------------

Thanks to @polyglot-jones for contributing to this new release — although I'm
afraid that due to some history rewrite operations on the development branch,
some of his commits ended up being attributed to me (sorry for that).
